R-scape v2.0.4.g  July 2024
	fixes a bug that was producing wrong results when running R-scape on alignments collected in the same file

R-scape v2.0.4.h  July 2024
	introduces option --CWC to calculate covariation using only pairs that conform with being Watson-Crick base pairs: A-U, U-A, C-G, G-C, G-U, U-G

R-scape v2.0.4.h  July 2024
	fixed bug in option --Rfam to display only nested covariations
	
R-scape v2.0.4.k  Sep 2024
	fixed bug in options --RFAFs --RAFSa 
	

R-scape v2.0.5 Sep 2024
	(1) Designe decision for how to treat gaps in the construction of the null models in function  msamanip_ShuffleTreeSubstitutions() msamanip.c was reverted.
	    Null alignments were too similar to the input alignment reducing the number significant base pairs.
	(2) Power curves have been recalculated using Rfam.15.0.seed.3D.sto. Now power is higher for the same number of changes.
	(3) Consequently in CaCoFold, the power threshold to decide that a base pair cannot form has been lowered.
	(4) The calculation of marginal probabilities in correlators.c has been modified, such that pairs of columns w/o  any Res-Res sequence result in zero covariation.
	All these changes affect almost exclusively alignments with many gaps

R-scape v2.0.5.a Sep 2024
	fixes a configuration issue with R2R in some systems

R-scape v2.0.5.b Oct 2024
	(1) reverted the single-residue probabilities to being marginals of paired ones
	(2) fixed an issue with rnaview which by default compared all strings as capitalized and it was failing for PDB file 8cgv which uses lower letter for chains: a,b,c,d,...
