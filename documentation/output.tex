\section{Outputs}

For each alignment file \prog{rnafile.sto}, \rscape\, produces the
following output files:

\begin{sreitems}{\emprog{rnafile.sorted.out}}
\item[\emprog{rnafile.out}] Tabular output with the significant pairs,
  with their score and E-value.
%
\item[\emprog{rnafile.sorted.out}] Tabular output sorted from highest to
  lowest E-value.
%
\item[\emprog{rnafile.roc}] Tabular output that provides statistics for 
each score value.
%
\item[\emprog{rnafile.sum}] Tabular output with a line summary statistics
  per alignment in the file.
%
\end{sreitems}

An Stockholm alignment file can include multiple alignments.  \rscape\
produces the following output files, one for each individual alignment
in the input Stockholm file:


\subsection{Alignment with consensus seconary structure}
If the given alignment does have a consensus secondary structure
(\prog{\#=GF SS\_cons} markup), the following files are produced

\begin{sreitems}{\emprog{rnafile\_msaname.R2R.sto.\{pdf,svg\}}}
\item[\emprog{rnafile\_msaname.his}] A two column histogram file for the
  covariation scores.
%
\item[\emprog{rnafile\_msaname.his.ps}] Plot of the score histogram.
%
\item[\emprog{rnafile\_msaname.R2R.sto}] Stockholm file annotated by a
  modified version of the R2R program. This file includes the
  information necesary to draw the consensus structure, and to
  annotate the significantly covarying base pairs.
%
\item[\emprog{rnafile\_msaname.R2R.sto.\{pdf,svg\}}] Drawing of the
  \rscape-annotated consensus secondary structure.
%
\item[\emprog{rnafile\_msaname.dplot.\{ps,svg\}}] Dot plot of the consensus
  secondary structure annotated according to covariation.
%
\end{sreitems}
For each alignment, \emprog{msaname} is given
by \prog{<ACC>\_<ID>}, the combination of the accesion \prog{\#=GF
AC <AC>} and name \prog{\#=GF ID <ID>} in the stockholm-format markups (or
one of two if the other in not defined).  If none of those fields are
defined, \emprog{msaname} is a number describing the order in the
file of the given alignment.

\subsection{Alignment without consensus seconary structure}
Alternatively, if the alignemnt does not have a consensus secondary
structure (or if it does and the option \prog{\rscape\ --cyk} is
used) \rscape\, produces the following additional files describing the
maximal-covariation optimal secondary structure:

\begin{sreitems}{\emprog{rnafile\_msaname.cyk.R2R.sto.\{pdf,svg\}}}
\item[\emprog{rnafile\_msaname.cyk.his}]
%
\item[\emprog{rnafile\_msaname.cyk.his.\{ps.svg\}}]
%
\item[\emprog{rnafile\_msaname.cyk.R2R.sto}]
%
\item[\emprog{rnafile\_msaname.cyk.R2R.sto.\{pdf,svg\}}]
%
\item[\emprog{rnafile\_msaname.cyk.dplot.\{ps,svg\}}]
%
\end{sreitems}
These files are formatted identially to those for describing the given
consensus structure.
