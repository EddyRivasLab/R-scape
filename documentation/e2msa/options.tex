The whole list of options can be found using 

\user{e2msa -h}\\

Some important options are:

\subsubsection{Evolutionary model options: \prog{--AFG,--AIF,--AGA,--AFGR,--AALI,--TKF91,--TKF92}}
We favor the AFG model, but a total of seven
are currently implemented in \etwomsa. 

The \etwomsa\ default is \prog{--AFG}.\\

\subsubsection{\prog{--paramfile <f>}}

We recomend to read the parameters of the above models from those provided in the
\prog{data/training} directory.

\subsection{Search options}

\subsubsection{\prog{--fixtime <f>}}

It fixes the time at which the evolutionary models are calculated. By default
the program optimizes in a pairwise manner the evolutionary time of each branch in the tree.

\subsection{Input options}

\subsubsection{\prog{-I <x>}} Only sequences with less than $0<x\leq 1$
pairwise similarity are considered in the analysis.  Pairwise \%
identity is defined as the ratio of identical positions divided by the
minimum length of the two sequences. If this option is not used all
sequences are used in the analysis.

\subsubsection{\prog{--submsa <n>}} Analyzes a random subset of the input alignment with <n> sequences.



\subsection{Output options}

\subsubsection{\prog{--voutput}}


\subsection{Other options}

\subsubsection{\prog{--seed <n>}} Sets the seed of the random number generator to $<$n$>$. Use n = 0 for a random seed.
