\section{Introduction}
\setcounter{footnote}{0}

\etwomsa\ is a local sequence alignment program that implements an
explicit evolutionary model.  By default \etwomsa\ implements the AFG
evolutionary model, but other affine evolutionary models introduced in
the paper: LI, LR, AFR, AIF, AGA (an other previous to this work, such
as TKF91 and TKF92) are also implemented.  The e2msa method provides a
platform for the level comparison of different affine evolutionary
models.


\subsection{How to avoid reading this manual}

\begin{itemize}
\item Follow the quick installation instructions on page
      \pageref{section:installation}. 
\item Go to the tutorial section on page
\pageref{section:tutorial}, which walks you through some examples of
using \etwomsa\ on real data.
\end{itemize}

Everything else, you can read later.
