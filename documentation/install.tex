\subsection{Quick installation instructions}

Download \prog{R-scape\_version.tar.gz} from \url{http://selab.org/}, or
from
\url{hhps://hithub.com/EddyRivasLab/XXX};
unpack it, configure, and make:

\user{tar xf R-scape\_version.tar.gz}\\
\user{cd R-scape\_version}\\
\user{./configure}\\ 
\user{make}\\

You will have to define an environmental variable RSCAPEDIR
poining to the newly created directory R-scape\_version.

\user{export RSCAPEDIR = ''<path-to-dir R-scape\_version>''}\\

The newly compiled binary (\texttt{R-scape}) is now in the \prog{src}
directory. You can run them from there.\\

That's it.  You can keep reading if you want to know more about
customizing a \rscape\ installation, or you can skip ahead to the next
chapter, the tutorial.

\subsection{System requirements}

\paragraph{Operating system:} \rscape\ is designed to run on
POSIX-compatible platforms, including UNIX, Linux and MacOS/X. The
POSIX standard essentially includes all operating systems except
Microsoft Windows. We have tested most extensively on MacOS/X because
these are the machines we develop on.

\paragraph{Compiler:} The source code is C conforming to POSIX and ANSI
C99 standards. It should compile with any ANSI C99 compliant compiler,
including the GNU C compiler \prog{gcc}. We test the code using both
the \prog{gcc} and \prog{icc} compilers. We find that \prog{icc}
produces somewhat faster code at present.

\paragraph{Libraries and other installation requirements:} \rscape\ includes
two software libraries: HMMER~\citep{Eddy11} and Easel (which is
already bundled as part of HMMER), and two independent programs
FastTree~\citep{Price10} (for building phylogenetic trees) and
R2R~\citep{WeinbergBreaker11} (for drawing consensus RNA
structures). All will automatically compile during \rscape's
installation process.  By default, \rscape\ does not require any
additional libraries to be installed by you, other than standard ANSI
C99 libraries that should already be present on a system that can
compile C code.

\subsection{Makefile targets}

\begin{sreitems}{\emprog{distclean}}

\item[\emprog{all}]
  Builds everything. Same as just saying \ccode{make}.

\item[\emprog{clean}]
  Removes all files generated by compilation (by
  \ccode{make}). Configuration (files generated by
  \ccode{./configure}) is preserved.

\item[\emprog{distclean}]
  Removes all files generated by configuration (by \ccode{./configure})
  and by compilation (by \ccode{make}). 

\end{sreitems}
