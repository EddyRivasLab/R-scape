\rscape\ (RNA Significant Covariation Above Phylogenetic Expectation)
is a program that given a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of RNA
sequences, finds the pairs of positions that show a pattern of
significant covariation. Each covariation score has an E-value
associated to it. E-values are determined using a null model of
covariation due to phylogeny but independent of any structural
constraints. 

\subsection{How to avoid reading this manual}

\begin{itemize}
\item Follow the quick installation instructions on page
      \pageref{section:installation}. 
\item Go to the tutorial section on page
\pageref{section:tutorial}, which walks you through some examples of
using \rscape\ on real data.
\end{itemize}

Everything else, you can read later.
