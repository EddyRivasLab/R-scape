Here's a tutorial walk-through of some how to use \rscape. This should
suffice to get you started.

\subsection {Modes of \rscape}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{MSA input with annotated consensus secondary structure}} \\ 
 & \\ 
\textbf{R-scape}   & Reports all pairs which covariation scores have E-values smaller or equal to a target E-value.\\
\textbf{}          & Draws the given consensus structure annotated with the significantly covarying base pairs.\\
 & \\ 
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{MSA input without an annotated secondary structure}}  \\
 & \\ 
\textbf{R-scape}   & Reports all pairs which covariation scores have E-values smaller or equal to a target E-value.\\
\textbf{}          & Builds the best consensus structure that includes all significantly covarying pairs,\\
\textbf{}          & \hspace{5mm}\emph{the maximum-covariation consensus structure}.\\
\textbf{}          & Draws the \emph{maximum-covariation consensus structure} annotated with the significantly covarying base pairs.\\
 & \\ 
\end{tabular} \\
\\

In the Tutorial section, I'll show examples of running each \rscape,
using examples in the \ccode{tutorial/} subdirectory of the
distribution.


\subsection{Files used in the tutorial}

The subdirectory \prog{/tutorial} in the \rscape\ distribution contains the
files used in the tutorial. 

The tutorial provides several examples of RNA structural
alignments, all in Stockholm format:

\begin{sreitems}{\emprog{minifam.h3\{m,i,f,p\}}}
\item[\emprog{updated\_arisong.sto}] Structural alignment of the ciliate
  Arisong RNA. This alignment is an updated
  version of the one published in \citep{JungEddy11}.
\item[\emprog{ar14.sto}] Structural alignment of the $\alpha$-proteobacteria ncRNA ar14. This alignment is an updated version of the one
  published in \citep{delVal12}.
\item[\emprog{RF00001.sto}] Rfam v12.0 seed alignment of 5S rRNA. 
\item[\emprog{RF00005.sto}] Rfam v12.0 seed alignment of tRNA. 
\item[\emprog{RF00001.sto}] Rfam v12.0 seed alignment of YRNA. 
\end{sreitems}


\subsection{Running \rscape\, on one alignment file}
Running \rscape\, with default parameters on the sequence
\prog{tutorial/updated\_arisong.sto}.

\user{bin/R-scape tutorial/updated\_arisong.sto}\\
Default parameters remove sequences that are more than 97\% similar to
each other (\prog{-I 0.97}), consider only columns that have at least
50\% of the positions occupied (\prog{--gapthresh 0.5}), and uses the
product-average corrected G-Test (\prog{--GTp}) covariation
statistic.
