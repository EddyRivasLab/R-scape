Here's a tutorial walk-through of how to use \rscape. This should
suffice to get you started.

\subsection {Modes of \rscape}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{MSA input \textit{with} annotated consensus secondary structure:}} \\ 
 & \\ 
\textbf{}   & Reports all pairs that have covariation scores with E-values smaller or equal to a target E-value.\\
\textbf{}   & Draws the given consensus structure annotated with the significantly covarying base pairs.\\
 & \\ 
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{MSA input \textit{without} an annotated secondary structure:}}  \\
 & \\ 
\textbf{}   & Reports all pairs that have covariation scores with E-values smaller or equal to a target E-value.\\
\textbf{}   & Builds the best consensus structure that includes all significantly covarying pairs,\\
\textbf{}   & \hspace{5mm}\emph{the maximum-covariation optimal consensus structure}.\\
\textbf{}   & Draws the \emph{maximum-covariation optimal consensus structure} annotated with the significantly \\
\textbf{}   & \hspace{5mm}covarying base pairs.\\
 & \\ 
\end{tabular} 

I'll show examples of running each mode, using examples in the
\ccode{tutorial/} subdirectory of the distribution.


\subsection{Files used in the tutorial}

The subdirectory \prog{/tutorial} in the \rscape\ distribution contains the
files used in the tutorial. 

The tutorial provides several examples of RNA structural
alignments, all in Stockholm format:

\begin{sreitems}{\emprog{updated\_Arisong.sto}}
\item[\emprog{updated\_Arisong.sto}] Structural alignment of the ciliate
  Arisong RNA. This alignment is an updated
  version of the one published in~\citep{JungEddy11}.
\item[\emprog{ar14.sto}] Structural alignment of the $\alpha$-proteobacteria ncRNA ar14. This alignment is an updated version of the one
  published in~\citep{delVal12}.
\item[\emprog{RF00005.sto}] Rfam v12.0~\citep{Nawrocki15} seed alignment of tRNA. 
\item[\emprog{RF00001-noss.sto}] Rfam v12.0 seed alignment of 5S rRNA, after removing the consensus secondary structure. 
\end{sreitems}


\subsection{Running \rscape\, on one alignment file}
To run \rscape\ with default parameters on alignment file
\prog{tutorial/updated\_Arisong.sto} use:\\

\user{bin/R-scape tutorial/updated\_Arisong.sto}\\

\noindent
The output is a list of the significantly covarying positions

A star ``*'' in the first column indicates that the pair is part of
the annotated structure in the \prog{updated\_Arisong.sto} file. A
blank indicates a pair that is not compatible with the structure. A
``$\sim$`` indicates an interaction not in the annotated structure but
compatible with it (none in this example).

\subsection{Default parameters}

Default parameters are:

\begin{sreitems}{\emprog{Pairwise percent identity:}}
\item[\emprog{Target E-value:}]default is 0.05. \rscape\, reports
  pairs which covariation score has E-value smaller or equal to the
  target value.  The target E-value can be changed with option
  \emprog{-E <x>}, $x >= 0$.

\item[\emprog{Sequence weighting:}]Sequences are weighted according to
  the Gerstein/Sonnhammer/Chothia (GSC)
  algorithm~\citep{Gerstein94}. This algorithm is time consuming. For
  alignments with more than 1000 sequences, we use the faster
  position-based weighting algorithm~\citep{Henikoff94b}. Both
  weighting algorithms are implemented as part of the easel library.

\item[\emprog{Gaps in columns:}]Columns with more than 50\% gaps are
  removed. The gap threshold for removing columns can be modified
   using option \emprog{--gapthresh <x>} , $0<x<=1$.

 \item[\emprog{Covariation statistic:}]The default covariation statistic
   is the average product corrected G-Test (equivalent to option
   \emprog{--GTp}).

 \item[\emprog{Covariation Class:}]\rscape\ uses the 16 component
   covariation statistic (C16), unless the number of sequences in the
   alignment is $\leq$ 8 or the length of the alignment is $\leq$ 50,
   in which case it uses the two-class covariation statistic (C2). A
   particular covariation class can be selected using either
   \emprog{--C16} or \emprog{--C2}.

   The threshold for the minimum number of sequences can be changed
   with option \prog{--nseqthresh <n>}.  The threshold for the minimum
   alignment length can be changed with option \prog{--alenthresh <n>}.

 \item[\emprog{Null alignments:}]In order to estimate E-values,
   \rscape\ produces 20 null alignments, unless the product of the
   number of sequences by the length of the alignment $<$ 10,000 in
   which case the number of null alignments is 50; or $<$ 1,000 in
   which case it is 100. The number of null alignments can be
   controlled with option \emprog{--nshuffle <n>}.
 \end{sreitems}

 A full list of the \rscape\ options is found by using

 \user{\rscape\ -h}
