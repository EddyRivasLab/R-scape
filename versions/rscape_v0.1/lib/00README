Downloading and Installing FastTree
===================================

FastTree 2.1.8 is available as

    Linux 64-bit executable (+SSE)
        Multi-threaded executable (+SSE +OpenMP) (see usage guide)
    Windows 32-bit command-line executable (no SSE)
    C code

If you use a Mac or other platform not included above, download FastTree.c and run

gcc -O3 -finline-functions -funroll-loops -Wall -o FastTree FastTree.c -lm

(gcc is installed on many Mac OS X and Unix machines. If you use a
Mac, you may need to install it from xcode. gcc is also available for
virtually every platform.) Note that FastTree will try to use
SSE2/SSE3 instructions to speed up some inner loops. This will not
work on many Windows or Mac machines. If FastTree will not run, then
try compiling it with this command instead:

gcc -DNO_SSE -O3 -finline-functions -funroll-loops -Wall -o FastTree FastTree.c -lm

If you want to build the multi-threaded "FastTreeMP," use

gcc -DOPENMP -fopenmp -O3 -finline-functions -funroll-loops -Wall -o FastTreeMP FastTree.c -lm

(The OpenMP version may not compile on some versions of Mac OS X
unless you install a different version of gcc.) See here for more
information about using FastTreeMP.

FastTree is open source software -- you are free to modify and
redistribute it as you wish. If you do make any improvements to
FastTree, please send them to us so we can incorporate your changes
into the main version.
