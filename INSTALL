 move into new directory:   cd R-scape_v2.5.7
 configure:                 ./configure
 build:                     make

The newly compiled binary "R-scape" is in the R-scape_v2.5.7/bin directory.
You can run it from there.

(R-scape_v2.5.5/documentation/R-scape_userguide.pdf).

The default installation produces executable: R-scape_v2.5.7/bin/R-scape

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting from a Git Repo: 

If you have cloned the R-scape Git repository, there's
some additional stuff you need to do one-time-only in your new working
directory.

First you need to clone easel and hmmer too:
  cd lib
  git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/infernal.git
  
  git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer.git
  git checkout develop
  cd hmmer/
  git clone https://github.dom/EddyRivasLab/easel.git
  git checkout develop
  cd ../../
  

And finally:
   cd lib/R2R
   ln -s R2R-1.0.7 R2R-current
   cd ../../
