The newly compiled binary "R-scape" is in the R-scape_v2.0.0.b/bin directory.
You can run it from there.

For complete documentation, see the R-scape User's Guide 
(R-scape_v2.0.0.g/documentation/R-scape_userguide.pdf).

The default installation produces executable: R-scape_v2.0.0.g/bin/R-scape

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting from a Git Repo: 

If you have cloned the R-scape Git repository, there's
some additional stuff you need to do one-time-only in your new working
directory.

First you need to clone easel and hmmer too:
  cd lib
  git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer.git
  cd hmmer/
  git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/easel.git

And finally:
   cd lib/R2R
   ln -s R2R-1.0.6 R2R-current
   cd ../../
