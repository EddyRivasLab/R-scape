----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting from a Git Repo: 

If you have cloned the R-scape Git repository, there's
some additional stuff you need to do one-time-only in your new working
directory.

First you need to clone easel and hmmer too:
  cd lib
  git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer.git
  cd hmmer/
  git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/easel.git

And finally:
   ln -s lib/R2R/R2R-1.0.6 lib/R2R/R2R-current
